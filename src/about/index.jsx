            We are a language learning app that helps people learn languages
            through news articles. Using the Gemini API, we convert articles
            into basic, intermediate, and advanced versions of the selected
            language. We are starting with Hebrew and targeting people who want
            to practice conversational Hebrew. More languages will be coming
            soon.
